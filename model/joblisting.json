Our groundbreaking technology, services delivery, and intelligence gathering together with our innovations in machine learning and behavioral-based detection, allow our customers to not only defend themselves, but do so in a future-proof manner. We’ve earned numerous honors and top rankings for our technology, organization and people – clearly confirming our industry leadership and our special culture driving it. We also offer flexible work arrangements to help our people manage their personal and professional lives in a way that works for them. So if you’re ready to work on unrivaled technology where your desire to be part of a collaborative team is met with a laser-focused mission to stop breaches and protect people globally, let’s talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the Role:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrowdstrike is looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join our growing Engine and Content Development (ECD) team which focuses on security related endpoint development on Windows, macOS, and Linux.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Engine and Content Development team is a central part of CrowdStrike’s mission - “We Stop Breaches.\"  In ECD, we implement strategies and processes that detect suspicious or malicious behavior. Our goal is to automatically stop the bad guys where possible, and to provide useful visibility and guidance to security analysts when new previously unknown adversary activity occurs. We research attacker behavior to understand their tools and techniques, and we build capabilities to detect and prevent malicious activity. Our detection strategies are often performed directly on the endpoint, but are also executed in cloud and may utilize a hybrid strategy combining aspects of both environments.  This ability to leverage a variety of tools across the CrowdStrike stack allow us to accomplish our detection goals while balancing local resource utilization and false positives for our customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a sensor engineer within the ECD team you will be focused on the analysis and development of detections for Windows based attack techniques across supported Windows OS versions. You’ll work collaboratively to implement these detections within the Falcon sensor which is a lightweight kernel-level module that observes system activity, recognizes malicious behavior, provides on-box prevention capability, and sends relevant security related data and telemetry to the Falcon cloud. You’ll help develop creative and resourceful ways to detect Windows specific threats while also helping develop cross platform features that cut across core OS subsystems such as analysis of file system, memory, process, and network telemetry. You’ll get exposure to both user-level and kernel-level coding practices.  You’ll collaborate with multiple teams within engineering, and will be expected to make significant contributions to the design and implementation of major development projects.
